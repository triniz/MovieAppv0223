Objective

Using React, build the client-side for an app called myFlix based on its
existing server-side code (REST API and database)

This app uses Parcel to build the code (Javascript, SCSS, JSX).

How to: install dependencies

npm install -g parcel
Installs Parcel as a global dependency
(Once app is fully deployed it is recommended to install it locally so that users have the same version as is in your package.json file)

npm install -save react react-dom
Installs react package for working with the dom

How to: run the app locally

Create a src folder in your project directory with three files > index.jsx, index.scss, index.html
run parcel src/index.html in terminal > instructs parcel to begin building your project from here
